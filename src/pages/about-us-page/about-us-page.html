  <h1> SANCTUS SILVA FLAG </h1>
  <p>
    4 colors- 4 values. The white, gold, and the black represent day and night, while the green represents the nature- our only constant. The tree represents many of the things we strive to be like, including strength, environmental sustainability, individuality,
    growth, and community contribution.
  </p>
  <h1> MOTTO- "Draw Strength from your Roots"</h1>
  <p>
    Sanctus Silva was created on the ideals of following one’s own opinions even if they are in the minority. By separating from the greater majority in the colonies we stuck to our own ideals and thoughts. This is embodied in the motto with the words draw
    strength from the root’s directly correlating to the basis of Sanctus Silva. It is significant to have a flag for our utopia so there can be an easy way for other regions to identify us in a visually appealing way.

  <p>
    The tree on the seal is one of our main symbols for the same reasons as the tree on our flag, striving to be strong, environmentally sustainable, individual, growing, and helpful to the community. Also, the roots (included in our motto) wrap around our
    flag’s background. The leaves represent our four values, tolerance, peace, creativity, and honesty, along with our motto written in the middle.
