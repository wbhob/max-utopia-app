Constitution of Sanctus Silva
 PREAMBLE - Georgia Norton

We, Sanctus Silva, strive to create a society based off of the values of ingenuity, tolerance, peace, and honesty. Sanctus Silva is to be a community in which all members are treated fairly and respectfully, and are held to the previous moral standards. We feel that our current society is irrationally violent and power hungry, and we are confident that we are capable of a more progressive and peaceful community. We aim to continuously strive for what is reasonable and right, and seek to improve both the lives of the community and the individual.

GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE - Barrett

	Sanctus Silva is run on the basis of an oligarchy where a small group of four people are the leaders or council of the society. The reason behind this structuring is the small amount of people in our Utopia, around fifty, which allows the oligarchy structure to work efficiently in our group. With four people running much of the government, it provides different opinions and ideas for the same topic. Within the government, however, there are smaller structures that report to the original council. These positions and organizations will provide voting positions and allow for a greater spread of leadership positions. The oligarchy structure has only been effective with smaller groups in the past, so with such few people in our society, we reasoned that it would be the perfect structure to run our utopia.


PUBLIC POLICY- Education

The education system of Sanctus Silva starts at age 4 and lasts 12 years for the students. The education system runs through the age of 15, and continuous through summer but is not daily. Also, it has irregular hours each day, and does not have a set requirements as long as the correct material is covered. The education system includes immersive, hands on learning in our environment. Children are required school for 12 years in order to become well rounded, intellectual individuals, and prepare for contribution starting after the age of 16. The most important subjects are sciences, as they prove most useful for agricultural, medical, and environmental studies, all of which are large contributions to our society. The education process stresses enjoyable and immersive learning, and classes are typically held outdoors, although there is a class setting for poor weather and other occasions.
