			<h4>Household Structure By Barrett Howell</h4>
			<p>
				A household consists of one or more people who live in the same dwelling and also share at meals or living accommodation,
				and may consist of a single family or some other grouping of people. To allow for all people to be able to live in a
				peaceful and controlled environment a certain structure must be placed to allow for the equilibrium of space, objects,
				and duties between all members of the household. In Sanctus Silva we allow for freedom of choice in all areas including
				the home unit which is based in treehouses in our sacred forest; It may consist of whomever and any number of people
				you decide. Marriage is allowed as well as all forms of symbolic bonding. The community as a whole helps raise each individual
				kid, however parent involvement is also necessary and strongly supported within the community.The community does not
				assign tasks within the household however. Gender roles are assigned within the family unit and are organized by the
				individual needs of the people in that unit; thus, our society seek to protect the family unit and its core values. see
				this as a need because more and more reports such as the Pew study, which reveals that 39 percent of Americans now believe
				marriage is becoming obsolete. Which compared to the fact that in 1978, 28 percent felt the same way there are some necessary
				changes to be made (Access World News). The evidence blatantly shows that there is a problem in today’s world that must
				be addressed to form a perfect utopia. One where the symbolism of marriage is still present and is sought after.

			<h4>Holidays and Celebrations By Max Hobbs</h4>
			<p>
				In Sanctus Silva they have 3 holidays, and a special way to celebrate birthdays. The 3 holidays are Feast Day, Summer Solstice
				Day, and New Years. The first holiday is Feast Day. Feast Day is when they are thankful for all the food their community
				has. It is extremely rare that they starve, so every year they have a feast. Feast Day is on April 27. The reason Feast
				Day is on April 27 is because it is right after the spring harvest. April 27 is usually when they have the most food.
				In addition to Feast Day, they have Summer Solstice Day. Summer Solstice Day is on June 21. Summer Solstice Day is when
				the people of the community gather around to celebrate another winter that has subsided`; because temperatures can drop
				down to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, winter is exceedingly brutal in their community. Also, on Summer Solstice Day they remember
				the people who passed away during the winter. Most of the people who passed away are only a couple of months old, even
				though some of the people who pass away can be adults. Most of them pass away due to hypothermia. Furthermore, they have
				New Years. New Year's takes place on January 1 every year. On New Years, they celebrate the start of a new year, and
				the end of an old year. They also reflect on their year and think about how they can make the upcoming year more successful.
				Additionally, on New Year's they like to sing, dance, and eat. The whole community participates in New Year's except
				the children under 10 due to their inability to stay up all night. Of course, they all help out with preparing the food.
				Finally, their community celebrates birthdays by recognizing everyone that had a birthday that month, and as a community
				they eat and sing in celebration. In summary, their community has 3 holidays and a special way to celebrate birthdays.
				they have Feast Day, Summer Solstice Day, and New Years, and they celebrate everyone’s birthday at the end of each month,
				if they had a birthday in that month.

			<h4>
				The Arts in Sanctus Silva By Georgia Norton
			</h4>
			<p>
				The utopia Sanctus Silva promotes arts in many forms, both visual and performance, as the arts help better both the community
				and the individual. In Sanctus Silva, visual and performing arts are both taught in school, beginning at a very young
				age. The community members pride themselves on being well rounded and intellectual individuals, and they believe that
				beginning to experience the arts in any form at a young age is vital to the development of a cultured and unique individual.
				Likewise, this early immersion into the arts can help create a more comfortable community for the next generation, as
				from early ages the children are taught the importance of tolerance and ingenuity, two of Sanctus Silva’s main values.
				Secondly, The community promotes artistic expression to more diverse ages in Open Stage Night. Open Stage Night is a
				time where the community may convene and witness performing arts displayed by other community members. Gatherings like
				this are a substantial part of the community culture, as the arts are highly valued do to their ability to teach both
				the individual and others much about themselves. Events such as this also better the sense of community; they create
				an inviting space for citizens to enjoy themselves and others. In closing, the arts in Sanctus Silva are openly promoted
				and valued, as they benefit the development of both the community and the individual's intellect and relationship.
